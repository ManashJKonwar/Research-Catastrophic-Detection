## General Information
- The aim of this repository is to perform rainfall prediction using time series based algorithms on real time rainfall station data.  
- Research on possible frameworks to achieve rainfall prediction for time series based data.  
- Develop a dashboard for exploring the dataset in process and also draw statistical insights on the same.

## Technologies Used
- Time Series
- Dash 

## Features
List the ready features here:
- Training and Inferencing Time Series based Framework - Done

## Setup:
- git clone https://github.com/ManashJKonwar/IP-Pointnet.git (Clone the repository)
- python3 -m venv IPPointnetVenv (Create virtual environment from existing python3)
- activate the "IPPointnetVenv" (Activating the virtual environment)
- pip install -r requirements.txt (Install all required python modules)

## Dataset Utilized:
- The daily dataset is based on data extracted from a rainfall station at [jennings](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets), louisiana, USA.  

## Usage
### For Training PointNet:
- python rainfall_prediction/train.py
### For Running Web Application:
- python smart_weather/index.py
